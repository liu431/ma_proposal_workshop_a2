# MA Proposal Workshop: Session 2


Welcome to the MA Proposal Workshop, session 2. The goal of this micro-workshop series, a subunit of the computational social science workshop for first-year MACSS students, is to help develop an intuition for cutting edge social science research and orient them to the thinking and expectations for the MA thesis requirement in the second year of study.

* The citations for *5 social science journal articles or books* that you intend to utilize in your MA Thesis Literature Review. You should format these in a standard citation format such as ASA, Chicago, or APA, as they would appear in the works cited section of a research paper.
